# Data Mining Project
## Project Requirements

### Project Topic & Dataset

- A dataset must be selected and a corresponding **data mining problem** must be defined.
- The dataset is expected to be **large-scale and multi-dimensional**.
- Publicly available datasets (e.g., Kaggle, Google Dataset Search, data.gov) or original real-world data sources may be used, with the latter being encouraged.
- Possible project types include:
  - Classification
  - Prediction (Regression)
  - Clustering
  - Pattern discovery / Association rules
  - Outlier detection
  - Or a combination of these approaches
- The **project topic and dataset must receive instructor approval** before development begins.

### Preprocessing & Interim Report

- **By October 31**, the following tasks must be completed:
  - Formation of project groups (minimum of four members) and topic approval
  - Initial dataset selection
- **By midterm week** (date to be announced), a **progress report** must be submitted including:
  - Data analysis and visualization
  - Data cleaning
  - Feature engineering and feature selection
- The progress report will account for **20% of the overall grade**.

### Evaluation

- Grading will be based entirely on project performance, progress, and reports.
- Detailed evaluation criteria and deliverable requirements will be provided by the instructor at a later date.
